# Gigster Booking Platform (Legacy Recovery)

This repository contains the legacy codebase, documentation, and reverse-engineering notes for the Gigster online booking platform.

## Objective

Modernize the platform in a lean, cost-effective way using open-source tools and minimal redevelopment by:

- Reconstructing backend logic from IIS-deployed code
- Replacing brittle frontend/backend elements gradually
- Documenting legacy flows to enable support and updates

## Repository Structure (Planned)

- `/src/` — Decompiled backend logic (.cs, .aspx)
- `/docs/` — System diagrams, usage notes, reverse-engineered flows
- `/sql/` — Database schema extracts and stored procedures
- `/ui/` — New frontend mockups (if any)
